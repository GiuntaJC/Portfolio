  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a man living in Oregon and taking classes at Epicodus. Both the names Joseph and Joey work for me, though I normally go with Joey in my day-to-day life. With the support of my boyfriend, friends, parents and many others, I am trying my best to grow my skills in what I love and turn it into a job I can be happy with.</p>
  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>I've been programming on and off since middle school, having started with some basic robotics followed by a short c++ class. I've always had a love for making things and seeing what I can do with the resources available to me. My boyfriend expressed an interest in working together on some projects, and shortly after I heard about Epicodus. Having no job and both a want and reason to learn more, I decided that it was the way to go.</p>
  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>There are many things that interest me. Here are just a few of them!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Video Games!</li>
    <p>Not only have I have enjoyed playing video games for as long as I can remember, but they have had major impact on my life. </p>
