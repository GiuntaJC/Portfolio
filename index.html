    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a man living in Oregon and taking classes at Epicodus. Both the names Joseph and Joey work for me, though <em>I normally go with Joey in my day-to-day life</em>. With the support of my boyfriend, friends, parents and many others, I am trying my best to grow my skills in what I love and turn it into a job I can be happy with.</p>

  <h2 class="background">My Background</h2>
  <p>I've been programming on and off since middle school, having started with some basic robotics followed by a short C++ class.<span class="highlight"> I've always had a love for making things and seeing what I can do with the resources available to me</span>. My boyfriend expressed an interest in working together on some projects, and shortly after I heard about Epicodus. Having no job and both a want and reason to learn more, I decided that it was the way to go.</p>
  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <h4>There are many things that interest me. Here are just a few of them!</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Video Games</strong></li>
    <p>Not only have I have enjoyed playing video games for as long as I can remember, but they have had major impact on my life. It was through them that I met the majority of my friends and my boyfriend, along with finding a love for programming!</p>
    <li><strong>Collecting Things</strong></li>
    <p>Whether it be trading cards, dip pens and desk sets, or many other things, I've had many different collections in my life. As a fan of <em>Art-Deco</em>, I often look for things of this art style. Some of my collections are still on-going, others abandoned for various reasons, but all giving me small goals, hours of fun and the joy of watching something grow as I put work into it.</p>
    <li><strong>Electronics</strong></li>
    <p>Electronics have always gone hand-in-hand with programming for me. Althrough I have put far less time into them, and am still definitely a novice, I would like to explore them further and see what I can do when I really dive in!</p>
